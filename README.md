# Vantage software simulation
- This software provide a simulation for interaction management between Vantage Pro2 Sensor Suite and Vantage Pro2 Console by Davis Instruments.
- This is the second project of TCSS 360, summer 2020. The main goal of this project is to experiment Agile development process and techniques, mainly Scrum. We are going to create a GUI for Vantage Pro2 Console which will receive weather information from the sensor suite and display them.
- We reuse components developed for Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) software in the first project, which was to implement multiple dummy sensors (from Vantage Pro2 Sensor Suite), generate random dummy data, and transfer them using serialization process.

## GUI demo
- Default console's GUI.

- Console's GUI with secondary buttons and different unit presentation.

## Supported platforms
- Theoretically, this should run on any platform that is compatible with JVM. However, we only use "PC" OS (mainly Windows, macOS) during the development process. It should work properly on "PC" OS.

## Execution process
- Install JDK on a machine.
- Using any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc) to import the repository.
- In the source code, there is a main package. That package contains FinalMain.java, which is our "main" class. The program is executed using that class.
